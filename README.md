In recent years, numerous studies have utilized various algorithms to analyze driver data. These algorithms encompass statistical tools and machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, naive Bayes, K-NN, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and LightGBM. Common to all these algorithms is their aim to predict or classify drivers into different risk groups for insurance claims based on vehicle characteristics, thus serving the needs of insurance companies.
This project applies the statistical tools and machine learning algorithms previously explored to a dataset characterized by diverse variables that describe the driver. These variables enable us to understand driver behavior and assess their potential for insurance claims using historical data from drivers with similar characteristics.
